# Slipstream-Runner
Momentum-Based Platformer — AI-Generated Proof of Concept
# Overview

Slipstream Runner is a 2D momentum-focused platformer created as a proof-of-concept AI-generated game. The project explores how an AI system can design and implement a mechanically complete platformer featuring speed-based movement, dashing, wall interaction, and level progression.

The game is fully playable and technically functional, serving as a foundation for evaluating AI-generated game design, movement systems, and player experience tuning.

# Core Features

Momentum-driven horizontal movement

Jumping, dashing, and wall-jumping mechanics

Gradually increasing difficulty across levels

Clear win conditions and level progression

Keyboard-based controls

Runs locally in the browser (HTML5 Canvas)

# Purpose of This Project

This project was intentionally designed as a working but imperfect system.

Slipstream Runner demonstrates how AI-generated games can:

Correctly implement core mechanics

Establish clear goals and progression

Produce a complete, playable experience

At the same time, it highlights common AI limitations:

Movement tuning that lacks precision

Mechanics that coexist without strong synergy

Feedback systems that communicate state but may reduce readability

These qualities make Slipstream Runner a valuable evaluation artifact for analyzing AI-generated gameplay rather than a finished commercial product.

# Technical Details

Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

Uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering

No external libraries or frameworks

Runs by opening index.html locally

# Design Evaluation Focus

This project is used to evaluate:

Momentum and control feel

Player agency vs. automation

Visual feedback effectiveness

Skill ceiling and mastery potential

AI-generated system completeness vs. polish

# Status

🧪 Proof of Concept / Evaluation Demo

This project is intentionally left unpolished to preserve its value as a case study in AI-generated game design.
